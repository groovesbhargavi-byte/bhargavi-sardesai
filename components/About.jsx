          I am a Kathak performer, choreographer, and dance educator drawn to the storytelling potential of movement.
          My practice is shaped by tradition yet continuously evolving, rooted in rhythm, gesture, and the emotional
          resonance of lived experience. Whether performing, creating, or teaching, I find meaning in the exchange between
          artist and audience, body and memory, story and space.
